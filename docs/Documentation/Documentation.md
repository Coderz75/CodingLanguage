One thing to note before using RunLang. It compiles directly into c++. Any errors shown will be errors in it's c++ version. The compiler will do it's best to convert those to something more like your program, however it cannot garuntee full conversion. Any overlaying libraries are written in c++, and thus are constricted to the rules of c++
